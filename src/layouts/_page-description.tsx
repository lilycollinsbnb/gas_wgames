      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to assist the community using the Godot engine or other
        Godot-derived engines by providing them with a trading platform they
        deserve. We are creating a constantly evolving platform, using the best
        technologies. We are passionate; everything we do, we do with love. We
        want to be the change, the force that drives game development forward.

      <h2>Characteristics of the marketplace</h2>
      <p>
        Here on the site, you'll find high-quality game assets provided by
        various development studios or individual game creators. These tools
        will allow you to elevate your skills as a developer â€“ enabling you to
        create games in Godot more quickly and efficiently. Our portal is also
        an excellent place to recycle failed or unfinished Godot games. Recover
        money, monetize the time spent on advanced game development or learning.
        Didn't reach an agreement with the publisher? Stuck with an unfinished
        game? Ran out of money, time, or energy? Recycle game code, graphics,
        and sounds!
